      <h1>RUMOURS</h1>

        <p1> <a href ="https://open.spotify.com/album/0BwWUstDMUbgq2NYONRqlu">“RUMOURS”</a> BY FLEETWOOD MAC IS THEIR ELEVENTH STUDIO ALBUM. IT WAS RELEASED IN 1977. RUMOURS IS ONE OF THE BEST SELLING ALBUMS OF ALL TIME, SELLING MORE THAN 40 MILLIONS COPIES AROUND THE WORLD. RUMOURS WAS FORMED AROUND INTERPERSONAL PROBLEMS WITH THE BAND, RANGING FROM RELATIONSHIP ISSUES TO ARGUMENTS AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS. MANY OF THE SONGS TELL THE STORY OF THESE ISSUES. </p1>

          THE ALBUM COVER FEATURES A PHOTOGRAPH OF STEVIE AND FLEETWOOD TAKEN BY HERBERT WORTHINGTON, A WELL-KNOWN ROCK PHOTOGRAPHER. HE’S PHOTOGRAPHED Fleetwood Mac MULTIPLE TIMES, AS WELL AS STEVIE INDIVIDUALLY, AND OTHER ARTISTS LIKE PARIS, BUDDY MILES, AND LITA FORD. IN THE PHOTO STEVIE IS DRESSED AS “RHIANNON” WHICH IS ONE OF HER STAGE PERSONA’S ORIGINATING FROM THE SONG OF THE SAME TITLE, AS WELL AS A WELSH MYTHOLOGICAL FIGURE.

        <p3> <a href="http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-fleetwood-macs-rumours-761363">RUMOURS</a> IS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ALBUMS AND I RECALL THE IMAGERY OF THE ALBUM COVER WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT IT. THE COMBINATION OF THE ICONIC PHOTOGRAPH, THE SIMPLE (BUT INTERESTING) CHOICE OF CREME COLOR FOR THE BACKGROUND, AND THE TENDRIL-LIKE TERMINALS OF THE TYPOGRAPHY COME TOGETHER TO FORM A POWERFUL IMAGE.</p3>
