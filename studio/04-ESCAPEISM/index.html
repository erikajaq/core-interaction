                  The album cover for Introduction to Escape-ism was designed by Dutch Independent Graphic Design Studio, <a href ="https://www.experimentaljetset.nl/"> Experimental Jetset </a> The studio is made up of three designers: Marieke Stolk, Danny van den Dungen, and Erwin Brinkers. Much of the work of Experimental Jetset is modernistic. Helvetica is used quite frequently. The studio previously collaborated with Gary Hustwit on the Helvetica documentary. The album cover features only two colors: yellow and black. simple, but bold elements give the cover a powerful presence. The typography is played with and used to give the illusion of creating optical shapes which are echoed in the abstract black shapes below the type.
