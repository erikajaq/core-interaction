        <h1> CORE STUDIO INTERACTION THEME </h1>
          <p> MY THEME FOR THE SEMESTERS WILL BE <strong>VISUAL DESIGN FOR MUSIC</strong>, <br> FOCUSING MAINLY ON THE DESIGN OF ALBUM COVERS.<br>
            HOWEVER, I WILL ALSO EXPLORE OTHER VISUAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS <br> THE VISUAL ALBUM, USE OF TYPOGRAPHY IN MUSIC VIDEOS,<br>
            AND ALBUM ART RELEASED IN CONJUCTION WITH ALBUM RELEASES.</p>
