              <a href="http://corpus.nyc/"> SHOW ME THE BODY </a> IS A NEW YORK BASED HARDCORE PUNK BAND. THEIR DEBUT ALBUM <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx89dInRiXc"> BODY WAR </a> was released in 2016. WHILE THEY ARE A PUNK BAND, THEIR MUSIC DRAWS HEAVILY FROM HIP HOP, NOISE, AND METAL AS WELL. THE BAND STRIVES TO CELEBRATE NEW YORK CITY, AND NEW YORK CITY YOUTH. THEIR SOUND IS CHAOTIC AND ENERGETIC. GRITTY AND DIRECT. THEY HAVE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A NEW VIDEO SERIES CALLED 'CORPUS TV' WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON THEIR <a href="http://corpus.nyc/TV/"> WEBSITE. </a> THE VIDEO SERIES FEATURES COLLABORATIONS AMONGST DIFFERENT ARTISTS IN NEW YORK, CELEBRATING NEW YORK'S YOUTH CULTURE.

THE VIDEO FEATURES DANCERS DANCING IN CIRCLES ALONG TO THE MUSIC, IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS FROM AN UNDERPASS, TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FORREST OF SOME SORT, TO AN UNDISCLOSED VENUE.
