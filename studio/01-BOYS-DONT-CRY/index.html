        ">BOYS DON’T CRY</a> IS FRANK OCEAN’S MAGAZINE THAT CAME OUT IN <br> CONJUNCTION TO
         THE RELEASE  OF HIS SECOND ALBUM, BLOND. THE<br> MAGAZINE IS HIGHLY VISUAL-CENTRIC,
          INCLUDING OVER 360 PAGES<br> WORTH OF PHOTOGRAPHY. IN ADDITION TO PHOTOS, THE MAGAZINE<br>
          ALSO INCLUDES NOTES FROM FRANK OCEAN, POEMS, RAPS, INTERVIEWS,<br> AND MORE.
           THE ZINE WAS ORIGINALLY GIVEN OUT  FOR FREE ALONG<br> WITH THE PHYSICAL PURCHASE
            OF BLOND. SOME OF THE COLLABORATORS<br> ON THE PROJECT INCLUDE HARLEY WEIR, TOM
            SACHS, KANYE WEST, AND NABIL.<br> IT FEATURED THREE ALTERNATE COVERS. MUCH OF
             THE PROJECT WAS<br> DESIGNED BY ZAK KYES AND GREGORY AMBO FROM <a href="https://www.zak.group/ZAK"> ZAK GROUP.</a>  THEY <br>
              CREATED THE STYLIZED FONT ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE.<br> THE TYPEFACE WAS
               HAND-DISTORTED BY THE DESIGNERS BY SCANNING<br> THE ORIGINAL TYPEFACE AND
                DRAGGING IT ACROSS THE SCANNER <br>AS IT WAS BEING SCANNED BY THE LAMP.

        BOYS DON’T CRY IS A PURE VISUAL TREAT. VISUAL ART HAS BECOME AN <br>INCREASINGLY
         IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF MUSIC - STARTING FROM <br> RECORD SLEEVES AND ALBUM COVERS,
         TO MUSIC VIDEOS - AND IS NOW <br> DEVELOPING INTO SOMETHING EVEN DEEPER WITH THE
         RECENT <br> EMPHASIS ON VISUAL ALBUMS AND ADDITIONAL WORK SUCH AS BOYS DON’T CRY.<br>
          HAVING A VISUAL ELEMENT TO MUSIC ACTS NOT ONLY AS A MARKETING <br> DEVICE, BUT
           ALSO AN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION FOR THE MUSICIAN THAT CAN <br> PERHAPS GO BEYOND WHAT
            THE MUSIC CAN DO. VISUAL STIMULANTS HELP TO <br> CREATE A TOTAL EXPERIENCE -
            TAKING UP TWO OF OUR MAJOR <br> SENSES (SIGHT AND HEARING,) AND SHOW HOW ART
            AND DESIGN CAN <br> TRANSCEND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEDIUMS.
