              ">BOYS DON’T CRY</a> IS FRANK OCEAN’S MAGAZINE THAT CAME OUT IN  CONJUNCTION TO
               THE RELEASE  OF HIS SECOND ALBUM, BLOND. THE MAGAZINE IS HIGHLY VISUAL-CENTRIC,
                INCLUDING OVER 360 PAGES WORTH OF PHOTOGRAPHY. IN ADDITION TO PHOTOS, THE MAGAZINE
                ALSO INCLUDES NOTES FROM FRANK OCEAN, POEMS, RAPS, INTERVIEWS, AND MORE.
                 THE ZINE WAS ORIGINALLY GIVEN OUT  FOR FREE ALONG WITH THE PHYSICAL PURCHASE
                  OF BLOND. SOME OF THE COLLABORATORS ON THE PROJECT INCLUDE HARLEY WEIR, TOM
                  SACHS, KANYE WEST, AND NABIL.IT FEATURED THREE ALTERNATE COVERS. MUCH OF
                   THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED BY ZAK KYES AND GREGORY AMBO FROM <a href="https://www.zak.group"> ZAK GROUP.</a>  THEY
                    CREATED THE STYLIZED FONT ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE.THE TYPEFACE WAS
                     HAND-DISTORTED BY THE DESIGNERS BY SCANNING THE ORIGINAL TYPEFACE AND
                      DRAGGING IT ACROSS THE SCANNER AS IT WAS BEING SCANNED BY THE LAMP.

            <p>
              BOYS DON’T CRY IS A PURE VISUAL TREAT. VISUAL ART HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY
               IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF MUSIC - STARTING FROM RECORD SLEEVES AND ALBUM COVERS,
               TO MUSIC VIDEOS - AND IS NOW DEVELOPING INTO SOMETHING EVEN DEEPER WITH THE
               RECENT EMPHASIS ON VISUAL ALBUMS AND ADDITIONAL WORK SUCH AS BOYS DON’T CRY.
                HAVING A VISUAL ELEMENT TO MUSIC ACTS NOT ONLY AS A MARKETING DEVICE, BUT
                 ALSO AN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION FOR THE MUSICIAN THAT CAN PERHAPS GO BEYOND WHAT
                  THE MUSIC CAN DO. VISUAL STIMULANTS HELP TO CREATE A TOTAL EXPERIENCE -
                  TAKING UP TWO OF OUR MAJOR SENSES (SIGHT AND HEARING,) AND SHOW HOW ART
                  AND DESIGN CAN TRANSCEND THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEDIUMS.
