              Enoch's album covers are typographical treats. They often feature bold display type and simple, almost abstract shapes representational shapes. The artwork mostly included abstract or minimalist are work that, at the time, stood out from other album covers. Many of the album covers designed by <a href = "http://www.albersfoundation.org/"> Josef Albers </a>, a German-born American artist well known for his minimalist use of color.
